Hello, my name is Byron and thanks for checking out my little corner of the internet! I am a Computer Science/Psychology undergraduate attending the University of Colorado at Boulder. I have been practicing Parkour since 2009 and programming since I was old enough to use a computer. Constantly figuring out how things work is my lifelong passion.
